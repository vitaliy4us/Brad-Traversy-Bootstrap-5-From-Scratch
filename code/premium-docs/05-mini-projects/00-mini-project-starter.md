# Mini-Project Challenges

Now that you know the fundamentals, we are going to work on a couple small projects before jumping into the main website projects. I have been trying to implement more challenges into my courses, so what I want you guys to do is to try to build the projects on your own. I will include the final project for download in each video. Open it up in the browser, look at it and try to create it yourself.

You don't have to do this. You can just follow along, but I would like to see you challenge yourself. Your code does NOT have to be the same as mine. There are many ways to do the same thing.

## Mini-Project Starter

For the mini-projects, we will be using the default Bootstrap CSS. In the larger projects, we will be using Sass so that we can change variables and customize Bootstrap and then compile our own CSS. However, I still created a very simple starter for the mini-projects.

You can download the starter files from this lesson. Here is what it includes:

## Starter Files

- `index.html` - This is the HTML file that you will be working in.
- `css/bootstrap.min.css` - This is the default Bootstrap CSS file. We are using v5.3.
- `css/styles.css` - This is where you will add your custom CSS.
- `images` - If there are any images, they can go in the image folder.
- `js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js` - This is the default Bootstrap JavaScript file.

The HTML is just a boilerplate that includes the files that we need. We may add other imports such as fonts and icons as we go along.

For each project, just copy the starter files into a new folder and then start working in the `index.html` file.
