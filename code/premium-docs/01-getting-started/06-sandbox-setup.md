# Bootstrap Sandbox Setup

For the next few sections, before we start on any of the projects, we're goinf to learn about the fundamentals of Bootstrap and all of the classes that are available. We're going to do this by using a sandbox, which is a collection of files where each file focuses on one or multiple topics. For instance we'll have a file where we focus on the margin padding classes, we'll have one that focuses on the navbar, etc. It's essentially the stuff you'll find in the documentation.

I will say this isn't going to be as fun as the projects, because each video is a standalone lesson and we're not really building anything, however it will drill these classes into your head and you'll learn how they all work before starting a project. If you feel pretty comfortable with Bootstrap already or if you know Bootstrap 4 pretty well, you should be ok to skip these sections and go right into the projects. If you want to do that.

## Getting Setup

So in this particular lesson, you'll find a download for the sandbox. You're going to get a starter version and the finished version. What I want you do do is download the zip file and put the starter version on your desktop or where ever you want and rename it from `bootstrap-sandbox-start` to just `bootstrap-sandbox`. Then open that folder in VS Code. You can use another text editor if you'd like, but I would really suggest using VS Code along with Live Server so you don't have to keep refreshing the page. Also we,ll be opening a new file with live server in every video.

As you can see, the first file that we're going to be working in is `01-containers.html`. So go ahead and open that in your editor and then right click and select `Open with live server` and you should see some text.

With a lot of these pages, I already added the text content, I just left out the classes because that's what we want to focus on.

Alright, in the next video, we will talk about containers.
