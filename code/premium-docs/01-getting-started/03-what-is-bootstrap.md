# What Is Bootstrap?

In this lesson, we will start at the very beginning and talk about what Bootstrap is and what it is used for.

Bootstrap is an open-source front-end UI or CSS framework used for developing responsive websites and user interfaces. It has been around for over a decade and has become extremely popular over the years as it's easy to use and offers a wide range of pre-designed components, such as buttons, alerts, navigation bars, and more. In addition to those types of UI components, you get utility classes to help you develop faster. For instance, if you want to add margin or padding, you can use classes to add it all around, to the top, bottom, left or right. There's classes for display and positioning. There is also a responsive grid system for column-based layouts. It also offers JavaScript components like carousels and collapsable content.

## Prerequisites?

It's really important to learn the basics and fundamentals of HTML and CSS before jumping into any framework. In order to understand many of the classes, especially the utility classes, you need to understand what they are doing as far as the CSS goes. For instance, you aren't going to understand the position-absolute class if you don't understand CSS positioning. You need to understand spacing to use the margin and padding classes.

Once you get the basics of HTML and CSS down, then you can use Bootstrap to move things along faster.

## Advantages Of Bootstrap

- Responsive Design: Bootstrap is responsive by nature. In fact, it uses what we call a `Mobile-first` approach. This means that Bootstrap prioritizes the design and development of mobile-friendly websites and applications. The framework's CSS styles and components are built to ensure optimal viewing and interaction experiences on smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets.

- Rapid Development: Bootstrap saves a ton of time. In many cases you will write some custom CSS, but not much. Most of the custom CSS that I write when using Bootstrap is for things like background images, overlays and animation. Bootstrap can take care of just about everything else.

- Prototyping: Since it allows you to do things so quickly, it's great for prototyping. If you're more of a backend developer and you're creatiing an application, Bootstrap is a great option to just get something up and running on the frontend until you can get a frontend developer to really customize it.

- Customizable: Bootstrap is customizable. There are a few ways to do it, but you can compile your own version of Bootstrap CSS. The most common way and what we'll be doing in this course is by using Sass, which is a style language. We can edit hundreds of variables that have to do with colors, sizes, borders and much more and then we can compile our own version of Bootstrap. Many people say that all Bootstrap sites look similar, but that's only if you use the default values. You can really change things up.

- JavaScript Plugins: I'm also a big fan of the Tailwind CSS framework. I think it's a different animal than Bootstrap though. What Bootstrap offers that Tailwind does't is JavaScript components. When we create a navbar, it automatically has a hamburger menu on small screens. We can use collapsible content, carousel sliders, popovers, modals and more. So it's not just UI elements.

- Documentation: The Bootstrap docs are great. They've always been one of my favorite sources of documentation. Every component with every option is laid out for you with working examples.

- Cross Browser Capability - Bootstrap works great across different browsers and operating systems.

## Is Bootstrap Dead?

You may hear that Bootstrap is dead from a few annoying influencers. In reality it's heavily used in both the enterprise level as well as startups and freelancing. So it's worth learning no matter what area you plan to work in.

Tailwind is another great framework. I use it. I even have a course on it, however some people absolutely hate it due to the amount of classes you use in your HTML. It's all utility classes and no components. So all of those people use Bootstrap when they want to use a CSS framework.

The only people that really say things are dead are influencers that want views and people that never really worked as a developer in the real world. Because in the real world people don't care what the cool thing to use is. They care about what will get the job done and get it done in a sufficient amount of time. Bootstrap is one of those technologies that really increases productivity and because of that, it's not going anywhere

Some large companies that use Bootstrap are Twitter, Spotify, Linkedin, Udemy, Upwork and many more.
